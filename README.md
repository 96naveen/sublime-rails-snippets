# Sublime Text 2 Rails snippets

I don't know who the original author is, but this repo is an improved version of https://github.com/bradrobertson/sublime-packages/tree/master/Rails

# Changes in this fork

* Prefer `=` over `-` for haml snippets (Rails 3 way)
* Prefer 'respond to format.html' over 'respond to wants.html'
